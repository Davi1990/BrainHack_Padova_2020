neuroscience: signal or noise?

When: December 14th to 16th, 2020
Where: the internet, wherever it lies

 Brainhack events bring together brain enthusiasts from a variety of backgrounds to build relationships, learn from one another, and collaborate on projects related to the neurosciences [1].
Participants can bring their own dataset, propose a project, and recruit a team of collaborators on site. Access to open online databases of MRI images will be also available during the three days, for new creative ideas to be tested.
This workshop integrates all levels of expertise and is also an opportunity to learn methods, develop skills, and collaborate with other participants in an international and multidisciplinary environment.
